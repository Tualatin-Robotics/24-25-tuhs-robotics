START : What do we need to start doing to improve how we work as a team?

  - Separate code repositories for each team
  - Specific programmers assigned to each team
  - A better teaching program (updated programming slides, YouTube videos about complex subjects, etc.)

STOP : What have we done that was unhelpful and should not be done next season?

  - Stop copying code between teams

CONTINUE : What are we currently doing that worked well and we should continue doing?

  - Writing code :D
  - Effective replay system
  - Having fun!
  - Teaching new programmers
